# keystalk

`keystalk` is a Node.js module for building peer-to-peer application
within Node.js using Tor. It combines ideas from BitTorrent for a DHT
and the idea of a chain of events ala Bitcoin.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/krisives/keystalk/wiki) for more on how this works under the hood.
